    <h1>My Favorite National Parks</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Denali National Park</li>
            <p>
                I visited Denali National Park a long time ago, but it was a great experience!
                I had never been to Alaska before, so that made it very unique in itself, but
                the coolest part was that I got to ride a helicopter up to Eldridge Glacier,
                which is on Mount Denali itself. Being on an actual glacier was definitely
                incredible!
            </p>
        <li>Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park</li>
            <p>
                In this national park, there are a lot of unique experiences. Most notably,
                I got to see a live volcano erupting from a distance away, which
                is definitely a one-of-a-kind view. Other opportunities include going on a 
                submarine and visiting Mauna Kea, the tallest mountain in the world! 
                (Though it's not the highest peak -- that's Everest.)
            </p>
        <li>Mount Rainier National Park</li>
            <p>
                Mount Rainier is a place of scenic mountain views, and it's breathtaking.
                There are green forests that are home to many creatures, but up on the
                mountains there are only sparse pine trees and tiny wildflowers. Though I
                didn't climb the mountain itself, its imposing silhouette in the distance 
                provided a beautiful view!
            </p>
        <li>Olympic National Park</li>
            <p>
                Olympic National Park is close to Rainier, but it is definitely a very
                different place. There is a wide variety of climates and biomes, from
                lush temperate rainforests full of vegetation, to rocky beaches right 
                on the edge of the Pacific Ocean. There's so much to explore and enjoy
                in this scenic location!
