                I visited Denali National Park a long time ago, but it was a great experience!
                I had never been to Alaska before, so that made it very unique in itself, but
                the coolest part was that I got to ride a helicopter up to Eldridge Glacier,
                which is on Mount Denali itself. Being on an actual glacier was definitely
                incredible!
